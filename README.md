# Unit_Testing Repository

Welcome to my Unit_Testing Repository! In this repository, you'll find a collection of Python scripts designed for various purposes with the purpose of utilizing the `unittest` library to perform assertive unit tests, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the implemented functionalities.

## Scripts

### 1. Employee.py

`Employee.py` contains the implementation of a simple employee class with various methods, including `give_promotion` and `attribute_length`. This class is designed not only to manage employee information but also to explore various object-oriented and class attributes and features.

### 2. Calculator.py

`Calculator.py` is a Python script that provides basic calculator functionalities, allowing users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 3. Find_anagram.py

`Find_anagram.py` is a Python script that identifies anagrams from a list of words obtained from the file `word_list.txt`. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.

## Testing

The repository includes testing files for each script, utilizing the `unittest` library to perform assertive unit tests.

### 1. Test_calculator.py

`Test_calculator.py` contains unit tests for the functionalities implemented in `Calculator.py`. These tests verify that the calculator performs the expected operations accurately.

### 2. Test_employee.py

`Test_employee.py` includes unit tests for the `Employee` class defined in `Employee.py`. The tests cover various methods, ensuring that the employee class functions as intended.

### 3. Test_find_anagram.py

`Test_find_anagram.py` provides unit tests for the `Find_anagram.py` script. These tests verify the accuracy of identifying anagrams within a list of words from the file `word_list.txt`.

## Additional Files

### 1. word_list.txt

`word_list.txt` is a text file containing a list of words. It is used as input for the `Find_anagram.py` script to demonstrate its functionality.
